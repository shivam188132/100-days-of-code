Pong Game
The Pong Game is a classic arcade-style game developed in Python using the Turtle module. It replicates the iconic gameplay of the original Pong game, where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. This GitHub project provides a simple yet entertaining implementation of the game.

Features:
Realistic Physics: The game incorporates basic physics principles to simulate ball movement, bouncing off walls, and interacting with paddles.

Two-Player Mode: Players can control their paddles using designated keys, allowing for engaging head-to-head matches.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score, displaying it prominently on the screen.

How to Play:
Controls:

Player 1 (Right Paddle): Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the paddle up and down, respectively.
Player 2 (Left Paddle): Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the paddle up and down, respectively.
Objective:

Each player aims to prevent the ball from passing their paddle while trying to send it past their opponent's paddle.
Score points by successfully getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.
The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined score limit.
Gameplay:

The game starts with the ball positioned at the center of the screen, and players can begin moving their paddles immediately.
Use strategy and timing to anticipate the ball's trajectory and position your paddle for a successful hit.
React quickly to the ball's movements to keep it in play and outmaneuver your opponent.
