# Pong Game

Welcome to Pong Game! This project provides a Python implementation of the classic arcade-style game Pong, utilizing the Turtle module for graphics. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen, aiming to prevent the ball from passing their paddle while trying to send it past their opponent's paddle.

## Features

- Realistic Physics: The game incorporates basic physics principles to simulate ball movement, bouncing off walls, and interacting with paddles.
- Two-Player Mode: Players can control their paddles using designated keys, allowing for engaging head-to-head matches.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score, displaying it prominently on the screen.

## How to Play

### Controls:

- **Player 1 (Right Paddle):** Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the paddle up and down, respectively.
- **Player 2 (Left Paddle):** Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the paddle up and down, respectively.

### Objective:

- Each player aims to prevent the ball from passing their paddle while trying to send it past their opponent's paddle.
- Score points by successfully getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.
- The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined score limit.

### Gameplay:

- The game starts with the ball positioned at the center of the screen, and players can begin moving their paddles immediately.
- Use strategy and timing to anticipate the ball's trajectory and position your paddle for a successful hit.
- React quickly to the ball's movements to keep it in play and outmaneuver your opponent.
